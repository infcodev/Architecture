# 0.1 - QuickNotes (Simple Notes App)

## Description
A minimal offline notes app where you can write, edit, and delete notes. No users, no sync, no backendâ€”just fast note-taking!

## Goals
- Get comfortable with basic app structures: lists, forms, state management
- Learn to save and load data using local storage (UserDefaults for iOS, localStorage for web)
- Start breaking code into small components/views
- Understand the flow for creating, editing, and deleting data

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI (iOS)
- React (Web)

> This is a warm-up project to get hands-on with UI basics and local persistence before tackling more complex architectures.
