# 0.1 - QuickNotes (Simple Notes App)

## Description
A minimal offline notes app where you can write, edit, and delete notes. No users, no sync, no backendâ€”just fast note-taking!

## Goals
- Get comfortable with basic app structures: lists, forms, state management
- Learn to save and load data using local storage (UserDefaults for iOS, localStorage for web)
- Start breaking code into small components/views
- Understand the flow for creating, editing, and deleting data

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI (iOS)
- React (Web)

> This is a warm-up project to get hands-on with UI basics and local persistence before tackling more complex architectures.

## Extra

1. *Lightweight Data Structures*:
    - Implement your own **undo/redo history stack** in QuickNotes.
    - Create a **dynamic array** that manually resizes (copy/double size algorithms) and measures times against a native array.
2. *Basic Testing*: TDD of a "word count" function used in QuickNotes.
