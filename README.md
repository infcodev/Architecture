# Practicing Software Architecture

This repo is my personal playground for learning and practicing advanced software architecture. Here, I'll build small projects and experiments to get hands-on experience with distributed systems, secure and scalable design, and combining mobile, web, backend, and AI agents.

The goal: understand, break, and master different architecture patterns by actually building stuffâ€”not just reading theory. Every folder is a different experiment or challenge for me to figure out how things work in practice.

If you're reading this, it's probably just notes and code for myself. But if it helps you too, cool!
